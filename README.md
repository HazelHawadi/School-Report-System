## Introduction
The School Report System is a Python-based application that leverages Google Sheets to manage and analyze student grades. The system allows for secure user authentication, collection of student grades, computation of average scores, and generation of detailed report cards. This application simplifies the administrative tasks associated with student performance tracking and reporting.
